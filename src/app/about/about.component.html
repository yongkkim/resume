      <h3>Background</h3>
      I have always been interested in becoming a computer programmer since I was young. After having been exposed to
      advancements in computer science and IT during the early 2000s, I have become even more interested in the field
      and
      have decided to pursue a career in computer programming. So I enrolled at Seneca College in order to achieve my
      dreams.

      <h3>During College</h3>
      During my four years of studies, I have learned a variety of programming languages like Java, C, and C++.
      However, I especially fell in love with web programming languages.
      I have learned about web programming technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, ASP.NET, PHP, and jQuery by
      completing academic projects
      and through an internship focused on upgrading a static website to a dynamic blog website.

      <h3>After College</h3>
      After I graduated, I was determined to upgrade my skills by learning new web programming technologies
      such as front-end JavaScript Frameworks (Angular and React) and back-end technologies (REST API, Database, and
      Node.js).
      I saw myself growing in confidence as a web developer.

    <div class="paragraph dream">
      <h3>My Dream</h3>
      I am committed to constantly upgrading my skills.
      I understand there are many existing technologies that I am yet to learn, and also new upcoming technologies.
      I will never stop learning, improving, and developing until I become a master of web development.
